We proposed a method to reduce the size of the training set used by a SVM algorithm, in order to reduce the training time. This method is based on the unsupervised learning algorithm called k-medoids, which is a variant of the algorithm k-means. The proposed method incorporates the statistics of the clusters formed by the algorithm k-medoids in the SVM scheme so that the optimization problem remains convex.
