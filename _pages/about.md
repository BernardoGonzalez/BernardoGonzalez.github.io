Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCSC. Prior to joining UCSC, I completed my Master's in Computer Science at the [Network and Data Science Laboratory](http://www.prime.cic.ipn.mx) at the [Computer Research Center](http://www.cic.ipn.mx) of the [National Polytechnic Institute](https://www.ipn.mx) , Mexico. My research interests are in the areas of theoretical machine learning and optimization. I have experience working with SVM, clustering algorithms and distributed optimization algorithms.
